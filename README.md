# OC : Food Application
***

In this project, I explore and value the content of the Open Food Facts data set to feed in an [imaginary food application](application_idea.md).

For a better and interactive navigation on the [notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/JulienfLeBoucher/OC_food_application/blob/main/cleaning_notebook.ipynb), I recommend using this link which uses nbviewer and avoid some GitHub incompatibility.

### Cleansing tasks conducted :
- handle duplicates and synthesize information ;
- detect outliers (unrealistic nutrients) ;
- improve/clean the classification of products ;
- impute missing values and replace outliers using KNNImputers and IterativeImputers

### Analysis tasks conducted:
-
